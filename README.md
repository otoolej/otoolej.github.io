# signal plus noise /sn/

Website of JM O' Toole, researcher in biomedical signal processing.  Point is to have somewhere central for code and publications, under my control---unlike other sites such as Mendeley and ResearchGate.

Website use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a nice theme stolen from
[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes).
